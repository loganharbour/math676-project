\begin{frame}\frametitle{One-group Linear Boltzmann Equation}
	Begin with the one-group S$_N$ transport equation for a single direction $d$ (neglecting boundary conditions for simplicity), as	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:boltzmann}
		\vo_d \cdot \nabla \psi_d(\vx) + \left(\sigma_a(\vx) + \sigma_s(\vx)\right) \psi_d(\vx) - \frac{\sigma_s(\vx)}{2\pi} \sum_{d = 1}^{N_\Omega} \omega_d \psi_d(\vx) = q(\vx)\,,
	\end{equation}
	where $\sigma_a$ represents a probability of particle absorption and $\sigma_s$ represents a probability of radiation scattering. Let $\mathbb{T}_h$ be the set of all cells of the triangulation in a discontinuous approximation space. The DG weak form with test function $v_d$ is
	\begin{multline}
		\sum_{K \in \mathbb{T}_h} \Big[ \pinp{-\vo_d \cdot \nabla v_d}{\psi_d}_K + \pinp{\psi_d^+ \vo_d \cdot \vn}{v_d}_{\delta K} + \pinp{\sigma_t \psi_d}{v_d}_K  \\ - \pinp{\sigma_s \phi}{v_d}_K = \pinp{q}{v_d}_K\Big]\,,
	\end{multline}
	where $\phi$ is the \textit{scalar flux}, $\phi = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_d^{N_\Omega} \omega_d \psi_d$, and $\psi_d^+$ is the upwind value of $\psi_d$ (the value from the side of the face in which $\vo \cdot \vn \geq 0$).
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Issue: Source Iteration}
	We commonly solve the transport equation by \textit{source iteration}, a form of Richardson iteration. Cast Eq. \eqref{eq:boltzmann} with iterative index $\ell$ as
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:source-iteation}
		\vo_d \cdot \nabla \psi_d^{(\ell + 1)} + \sigma_t \psi_d^{(\ell + 1)} = \sigma_s \phi^{(\ell)} + q\,,
	\end{equation}
	where $\ell$ is the iterative index, $\psi_d^{(0)} = \phi^{(0)} = \vec{0}$. After solving each direction, $d$, for an iteration $\ell$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:source-iteation}, update the scalar flux with
	\[
		\phi^{(\ell + 1)} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{d = 1}^{N_\Omega} w_d \psi_d^{(\ell + 1)}\,.
	\]
	$\psi^{(\ell + 1)}$ is the particles that have scattered at most $\ell$ times. As $\sigma_s / \sigma_t \to 1$, particles scatter more before they are absorbed $\rightarrow$ \textbf{\textcolor{Maroon}{the number of source iterations becomes significant!}} This problem becomes the goal of this work: introduce a diffusion problem as a preconditioner for Eq. \eqref{eq:source-iteation}.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Example: Lots of Scattering}
	Introduce $\spatial = [0, 10]^2$, $N_\Omega = 20$, $q = 1$, $\sigma_a + \sigma_s = \sigma_t = 100$, and $64^2$ elements. Increase the scattering ratio, $\sigma_s / \sigma_t$ and observe results.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Diffusion Acceleration}
	\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Simple algebraic manipulations can show that the error in $\psi^{\ell + 1}$ satisfies the transport equation with a source equal to:
			\[
				R^{\ell + 1} = \frac{\sigma_s}{2\pi} (\phi^{\ell + 1} - \phi^\ell)\,.
			\]

	\begin{itemize}
		\item A Fourier analysis shows (above and to the right) that the transport equation with a diffusion approximation attenuates the errors most poorly attenuated by the transport sweep.
		\item \textbf{\textcolor{Maroon}{Project goal:}} cast the transport problem for the error in $\psi^{\ell + 1}$ using the diffusion approximation as an acceleration to source iteration.
		\begin{itemize}
			\footnotesize
			\item This requires an S$_N$ solver (done) and a diffusion solver (starting).

\begin{frame}\frametitle{So far...}
	\begin{block}{Completed}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A one-group, 2D neutron transport code using the S$_N$ approximation has been developed using linear discontinuous finite elements in Deal.ii.
			\item Verified using known constant source solutions and MMS.
			\item Primarily uses the \texttt{MeshWorker} interface as discussed in step-12.
			\item \texttt{downstream\_renumbering} preconditions the within-direction solve.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Frustrations \tiny{(fewer than expected)}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Discontinuous finite element is new to me. Not like the majority of Deal.ii, \texttt{MeshWorker} took some getting used to.
			\item I really need to quit spending so much time on architecture...
			\item S$_N$ transport has specified directions of travel, therefore the discontinuous weak form is somewhat intuitive. This is not the case with diffusion transport, therefore the DFEM weak form isn't as fun.
