\begin{frame}\frametitle{One-group Linear Boltzmann Equation}
	Begin with the one-group S$_N$ transport equation for a single direction $d$ (neglecting boundary conditions for simplicity), as	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:boltzmann}
		\vo_d \cdot \nabla \psi_d(\vx) + \left(\sigma_a(\vx) + \sigma_s(\vx)\right) \psi_d(\vx) - \frac{\sigma_s(\vx)}{2\pi} \sum_{d = 1}^{N_\Omega} \omega_d \psi_d(\vx) = q(\vx)\,,
	\end{equation}
	where $\sigma_a$ represents a probability of particle absorption and $\sigma_s$ represents a probability of radiation scattering. Let $\mathbb{T}_h$ be the set of all cells of the triangulation in a discontinuous approximation space. The DG weak form with test function $v_d$ is
	\begin{multline}
		\sum_{K \in \mathbb{T}_h} \Big[ \pinp{-\vo_d \cdot \nabla v_d}{\psi_d}_K + \pinp{\psi_d^+ \vo_d \cdot \vn}{v_d}_{\delta K} + \pinp{\sigma_t \psi_d}{v_d}_K  \\ - \pinp{\sigma_s \phi}{v_d}_K = \pinp{q}{v_d}_K\Big]\,,
	\end{multline}
	where $\phi$ is the \textit{scalar flux}, $\phi = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_d^{N_\Omega} \omega_d \psi_d$, and $\psi_d^+$ is the upwind value of $\psi_d$ (the value from the side of the face in which $\vo \cdot \vn \geq 0$).
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Source Iteration}
	We commonly solve the transport equation by \textit{source iteration}, a form of Richardson iteration. Cast Eq. \eqref{eq:boltzmann} with iterative index $\ell$ as
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:source-iteation}
		\vo_d \cdot \nabla \psi_d^{(\ell + 1)} + \sigma_t \psi_d^{(\ell + 1)} = \sigma_s \phi^{(\ell)} + q\,,
	\end{equation}
	where $\ell$ is the iterative index, $\psi_d^{(0)} = \phi^{(0)} = \vec{0}$. After solving each direction, $d$, for an iteration $\ell$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:source-iteation}, update the scalar flux with
	\[
		\phi^{(\ell + 1)} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{d = 1}^{N_\Omega} w_d \psi_d^{(\ell + 1)}\,.
	\]
	$\psi^{(\ell + 1)}$ is the particles that have scattered at most $\ell$ times. As $\sigma_s / \sigma_t \to 1$, particles scatter more before they are absorbed $\rightarrow$ \textbf{\textcolor{Maroon}{the number of source iterations becomes significant!}} This problem becomes the goal of this work: introduce a diffusion problem as a preconditioner for Eq. \eqref{eq:source-iteation}.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Lots of Scattering}
	Introduce $\spatial = [0, 10]^2$, $N_\Omega = 20$, $q = 1$, $\sigma_a + \sigma_s = \sigma_t = 100$, and $64^2$ elements. Increase the scattering ratio, $\sigma_s / \sigma_t$ and observe results.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Diffusion Acceleration}
	\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Simple algebraic manipulations can show that the error in $\psi^{\ell + 1}$ satisfies the transport equation with a source equal to:
			\[
				R^{\ell + 1} = \frac{\sigma_s}{2\pi} (\phi^{\ell + 1} - \phi^\ell)\,.
			\]

	\end{minipage}
	\vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A Fourier analysis shows (above and to the right for $\sigma_s / \sigma_t = 1$) that the transport equation with a diffusion approximation attenuates the errors most poorly attenuated by the transport sweep.
		\vspace{0.05cm}
		\item \textbf{\textcolor{Maroon}{Project goal:}} cast the transport problem for the error in $\psi^{\ell + 1}$ using the diffusion approximation as an acceleration to source iteration.
		\begin{itemize}
			\footnotesize
			\vspace{0.05cm}
			\item This requires an S$_N$ solver (complete) and a diffusion solver (starting).

\begin{frame}\frametitle{So far...}
	\begin{block}{Completed}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A one-group, 2D neutron transport code using the S$_N$ approximation has been developed using linear discontinuous finite elements in Deal.ii.
			\item Verified using known constant source solutions and MMS.
			\item Primarily uses the \texttt{MeshWorker} interface as discussed in step-12.
			\item \texttt{downstream\_renumbering} preconditions the within-direction solve.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Frustrations \tiny{(fewer than expected)}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Discontinuous finite element is new to me. Not like the majority of Deal.ii, \texttt{MeshWorker} took some getting used to.
			\item \textbf{I really need to quit spending so much time on architecture...}
			\item S$_N$ transport has specified directions of travel, therefore the discontinuous weak form is somewhat intuitive. This is not the case with diffusion transport, therefore the DFEM weak form isn't as fun.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Aside: Downstream Renumbering}
	\begin{minipage}{0.52\linewidth}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The S$_N$ problem with upwind approximation $\rightarrow$ matrix solves can be local if solved in the upstream direction.
			\item Mixing \texttt{downstream()} with a Gauss-Seidel preconditioner mimics this behavior. Otherwise, solve with Richardson iteration.
			\item Consider a $[0,10]^2$ domain, $N_\Omega = 20, q = 1, \sigma_s = 10, \sigma_t = 100, 25^2$ elements. Refine the mesh uniformly and observe effect of renumbering DoFs based on direction.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Coming soon \tiny{(maybe? hopefully?)}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I've been through plenty of literature review on diffusion acceleration techniques for S$_N$ transport and have a choice for a penalty method (similar to as done in step-39).
		\item The solving architecture and variable transfers between S$_N$ and diffusion is ready in the code $\rightarrow$ need to write up and code the assembly \neutranie
